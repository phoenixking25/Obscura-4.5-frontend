This IBM service rep, hardware engineer, and software
engineer were driving down the road one day and they had a flat.  The
service rep wanted to replace the car, the hardware engineer thought
they could work around it, and the software engineer said 'maybe if
we ignore it, it'll go away'.

A political activist named Dave was just arriving in Hell, and was told
he had a choice to make. He could go to Capitalist Hell or to Communist
Hell. Naturally, Dave wanted to compare the two, so he wandered over to
Capitalist Hell. There outside the door was Adam Smith, looking bored.
"What's it like in there?" asked Dave.

"Well," replied Adam, "In Capitalist Hell, they flay you alive, boil
you in oil, chain you to a rock and let a vulture tear your liver out,
and cut you up into small pieces with sharp knives."

"That's terrible!!" gasped Dave. "I'm going to check out Communist
Hell!" He went over to Communist Hell, where he discovered a huge line
of people waiting to get in; the line circled around the lobby seven
times before receding off into the horizon.

Dave pushed his way through to the head of the line, where he found
Karl Marx busily signing people in. Dave asked Karl what Communist Hell
was like.

"In Communist Hell," said Marx impatiently, "they flay you alive, boil
you in oil, chain you to a rock and let vultures tear out your liver,
and cut you up into small pieces with sharp knives."

"But ... but that's the same as Capitalist Hell!" protested Dave.

"True," sighed Marx, "but sometimes we don't have oil, sometimes we
don't have knives ..."

An American, an Englishman and a Japanese fellow were discussing
  their respective countries over drink at a London pub one evening.
      The English fellow mentioned how that British medicine had
  progressed so far that doctors recently had taken a single liver and
  cut it into six pieces then transplanted it into six separate men
  in need of a healthy liver. This had resulted in six new workers
  in the job market.
      At this, the Japanese guy said that in his country doctors had
  cut a lung into twelve pieces, transplanted these into twelve people
  in need of healthy lungs, thereby putting twelve new people in the
  job market.
      Not to be outdone, the American said "That's nothing. In the
  U.S. we took one asshole, made it President, and now there are
  10 million people in the market for a job."
